# PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Overview:** Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics

# Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a Chrome extension that tracks time spent on various websites and provides users with detailed productivity analytics. The extension helps users understand their browsing habits, set productivity goals, and improve time management. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, user-friendly tool.

# Key Features:

1.Frontend Technologies:

-> HTML: To structure the extension popup and options pages.

-> CSS: To style the user interface for an intuitive and professional design.

-> JavaScript: To handle core functionalities like time tracking, data storage, and analytics.

2.Time Tracking:

-> Monitor and log time spent on individual websites in real time.

-> Display active and idle time to differentiate productive and unproductive browsing.

3.Productivity Analytics:

-> Provide visual insights using charts and graphs (e.g., pie charts for website categories).

-> Show daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of browsing activity.

-> Classify websites as "productive" or "distracting" based on user input or predefined categories.

4.User Goals and Alerts:

-> Allow users to set daily productivity goals (e.g., "Spend less than 2 hours on social media").

-> Trigger notifications or alerts when users exceed their set limits.

5.Extension UI Components:

-> Popup Interface: Display a summary of current activity and key stats.

-> Options Page: Enable customization of categories, goals, and preferences.

6.Data Persistence:

-> Use Chrome's storage API to save user preferences and browsing data locally.

-> Optionally provide export functionality for offline analysis.

7.Responsive and Lightweight Design:

-> Ensure the extension is responsive and doesn't slow down browser performance.

# Project Flow:

1.Setup and Manifest File Creation:

-> Create the manifest.json file with details about the extension, permissions, and entry points.

2.Frontend Design:

-> Build the popup UI and options page using HTML and CSS.

3.Core Functionality Implementation:

-> Use JavaScript to track time spent on tabs and domains.

-> Log browsing data and classify websites into categories.

4.Productivity Analytics:

-> Use libraries like Chart.js or Google Charts to generate visual reports.

-> Implement logic to calculate and display productivity scores.

5.Notifications and Alerts:

-> Integrate Chromeâ€™s notifications API to remind users about goals or excessive usage.

6.Testing and Debugging:

-> Test the extension on various websites and scenarios.

-> Ensure compatibility with the latest version of Chrome.

7.Packaging and Deployment:

-> Package the extension and publish it to the Chrome Web Store.

# Outcome:
This project equips you with skills to create browser extensions while reinforcing your expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides practical experience in time management tools, user experience design, and data visualization. Upon completion, the extension will serve as a valuable productivity aid for users and a significant addition to your portfolio.
